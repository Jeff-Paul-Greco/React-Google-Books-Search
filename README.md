# React Google Books Search

Full MERN Stack app developed solely by me. Site returns search results via Google Books API and then
allows the user to save searched entries and access/delete them later via MongoDB. App uses
React.js, Bootstrap, Mongoose, Express.js., Node.js and Axios.

# Instructions

1. Enter a book title into the search field and then click the submit button below. A list of books returned via Google Books API will be displayed below with their title, author(s), an image and a description for each book.

2. Below each search result you will see two buttons. Clicking View will take the user to the Google Books page for that book. Clicking Save will save the book to a seperate page where the user can view it at a later time.

3. Clicking the Saved button on the navbar will take the user to a page with all of their saved books. On this page each book will have two buttons below them - View and Delete. View takes the user to the Google Books page while Delete will delete this book from the saved list.
